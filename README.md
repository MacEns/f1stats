# Formula 1 Stats App

This app is to pull the current Formula 1 stats and details for drivers, constructors and past and future Grand Prix events and display them to the user.

Currently, the data is fetched from the <a href="https://ergast.com/mrd/">Ergast.com API for Formula 1</a> and stores in locally in memory.

The UI is written in the SwiftUI framework for responsive design that stays consistent throughout the iOS platform, with future plans to support iPadOS and macOS.
